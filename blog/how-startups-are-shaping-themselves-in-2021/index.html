We’ve lost a great amount this past year, as individuals and as a society of people. But we have also learned so many new ideas about how to connect despite the need to socially distance ourselves from each other. This issue that we all faced has created room for us to be more innovative and to create a world where we don’t need to do things traditionally to have a high-quality life.</p><aside><figure class="full-width-figure featured"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/assets/pictures/blog/how-startups-are-shaping-themselves-in-2021/a-young-worried-businessman-800.webp 800w, https://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/assets/pictures/blog/how-startups-are-shaping-themselves-in-2021/a-young-worried-businessman-1200.webp 1200w, https://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/assets/pictures/blog/how-startups-are-shaping-themselves-in-2021/a-young-worried-businessman-1600.webp 1600w" sizes="

Digital transformation has been one of the few positive understandings that have come out of the pandemic and the traumatic year of 2020. With so many tech companies already lining up the ability to work remotely, quarantine and the pandemic became a great way to test out their ability to continue to grow under extreme circumstances.</p><p>Before, companies and businesses had more room to not rush into utilizing more methods that engaged with virtual connection, but now more than ever it has become incredibly important for those same spaces to adapt to not working at the office. These new business practices of working in a virtual environment don’t seem to be going away, even with vaccines being administered and places opening up. What is important for new tech companies to understand is how much 2020 and the pandemic have impacted how new companies will engage with achieving their goal.</p><p>The trends of 2021 show us that community is very important as people don’t just want to buy a product, they want to be a part of a bigger experience. Consumers want to be able to interact and learn from each other on a platform, they want to have the chance to learn from each other and the company that they are connecting with. People are working remotely more than ever so when new tech companies create a platform that allows people to engage with their products more interactively, it gives them a chance to form community and even the possibility to collaborate with other consumers.</p><p>It’s also important for new startup companies to recognize the importance of sustainability and having an understanding of climate change in your companies practices. People are more aware than ever of how we impact the environment with our consumerism. They want to know that the company that they are choosing to connect with recognizes that and works to present a better way to engage with our world. We’re also understanding the real value of cryptocurrency and how it will impact the state of the economy in the next few years.</p><p>2021 will be a year where new companies need to learn how to engage with connecting more people and recognize the social as well as the political state of the world.</p></div></div></div></article></main></div><aside class="site-footer-outer"><footer class="site-footer"><div class="footer-logo"><span style="font-weight:700">marshmallow</span><span style="font-weight:400">challenge</span><span style="font-weight:700" class="logo-line">|</span></div><div class="footer-copyright"><span><a href="https://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/sitemap.xml">sitemap</a></span> | <span><a href="mailto:info@marshmallowchallenge.com">email</a></span></div></footer></aside></div><script defer="defer" src="https://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
